Part A Project Brief: AudioVizzion

AudioVizzion is a large retail chain that offers optical and audiology services and essentially sells glasses and hearing devices to the public. AudioVizzion operates globally from a large number of branches located all around Britain. Every branch offers AudioVizzion customers the opportunity to get tested on their vision and/or on their hearing before being able to purchase what the company refers to as Visual Devices (i.e. frames and lenses for glasses) and/or Hearing Devices (i.e. hearing aids).

A customer first contacts AudioVizzion to make a booking for a test, either for a vision test or for an audio test, depending on their specific needs. 
Once the booking for the test is agreed and a date and time is set for the test to take place at a specific branch, it is conducted by a specialised member of staff from AudioVizzion: an optician for a vision test or an audiologist for a hearing test.
 A vision test typically measures visual acuity, retinoscopy, and refraction, while an audio test simply measures the patient’s hearing level. At the end of a test, the member of staff records a number of comments and from there a prescription is produced.
 The prescription provides a detailed summary of the test results, but also the date from which it is available (i.e. the date when the test took place) and the date until when it is available (i.e. the date when the test took place to which 2 years are added)

The customer can then proceed and place an order to purchase a device (either a Visual Device or a Hearing Device) based on the obtained prescription.
 If they wish to purchase a Visual Device, they can select a frame for glasses (the company offers many brands and models) and/or lenses (the lenses are identified with their own serial numbers and have different vision types, tints and levels of thinness). 
If they are interested in ordering a Hearing Device, they can choose from several makes and models. They can place their orders at any of the AudioVizzion branches, as most convenient, and the order is processed by a sales assistant at the branch who is responsible for the order and for notifying the customer of the expected collection date and time, and for contacting them when their order is actually ready for collection. The sales assistant also subsequently updates the status of the order.

It is to be noted that not all members of staff at AudioVizzion work at a specific branch and that there are other members of staff who are not necessarily involved in the direct provision of optical and audiology services and work in other parts of the company.
